### Project Motivation

> For this project, you will pick a dataset. Inspired by Robert, there are a few public datasets from AirBnB available below, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data.

I chose Airbnb data in Boston and Seattle, and have the following three questions:

- What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb in Boston and Seattle?

- Is there any kinds of difference between Seattle and Boston Airbnb?

- What are the influencial features about the rental price?

### Data

The data about Airbnb in Boston and Seattle can be downloaded from **Kaggle**:
