This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Project Motivation

> For this project, you will pick a dataset. Inspired by Robert, there are a few public datasets from AirBnB available below, but you may also choose a dataset similar to what was used in the lessons, or an entirely different dataset. Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data.

I chose Airbnb data in Seattle, and have the following three questions:

- What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb in Seattle?

- What kinds of airbnb homes are popular?

- What are the most influencial features about the rental price?

### Data

The data about Airbnb in Seattle can be downloaded from **Kaggle**:
